# FrisbeeSim
Here is the published version of the videogame saga to unlock the "I'm Protagonist Of A Video Game Saga" accievement for my sister. Have fun.
Both games are written in C und can be compiled manually. 

Part 1 is a simple story telling game. Pat 2 is a frisbee-simulation. 

In the code of part 2 you can edit the screen resolution, but for now, when changed you have to resize the output-window accordingly. This feature is not tested well.
